**Super Filtered Hopper** is a blatent ripoff of a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod **Super Hopper** which lets you upgrade
hoppers to transfer items between chests. But I added a filter function using chests beside the hopper.

## Install
1. Install the latest version of...
   * [SMAPI](https://smapi.io);
   * and [Automate](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1063).
3. Install [this mod from Nexus Mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9418).
4. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Use
Left-click a [hopper](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Hopper) with an [iridium
bar](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Iridium_Bar), and it will change colors and start moving things
from a chest above it to a chest below it. Left-click it with an empty hand to downgrade it and get
your iridium bar back. Add an adjectcent chest with all the items you want it to move.if one isn't
found it will move everything

## Compatibility
Compatible with Stardew Valley 1.6+ on Linux/macOS/Windows, both single-player and multiplayer.
at least hopefully I don't know what I'm doing.
